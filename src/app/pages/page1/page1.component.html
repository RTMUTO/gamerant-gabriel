      The game that seems the most likely to appear at next month's rumored
      PlayStation event is the Silent Hill 2 remake being developed by Bloober
      Team. Recent leaked promotional material from GameStop and an ESRB rating
      for Silent Hill 2 appearing online suggest the game is approaching
      release, which lines up with statements made by reputable insider Jeff
      Grubb on the Giant Bombcast that the release date will be announced for
      Silent Hill 2 at this event in May.

      Ghost of Tsushima 2
    </h3>

      While the game hasn't been confirmed to be in development, the success of
      Sucker Punch's 2020 hit Ghost of Tsushima could mean a sequel is on its
      way. According to leaker Silknigth, Ghost of Tsushima 2 is set to be
      revealed in the coming months, potentially putting it in a prime position
      to be announced at May's PlayStation event. While it likely won't be
      released before April 2025, it would still be exciting to see what Sucker
      Punch has in store for this follow-up.

    <h3 class="text-4xl font-bold tracking-tighter pt-3">Concord</h3>

      class="text-2xl tracking-tighter px-4 pt-3 text-slate-700 self-start text-justify"

      Originally announced at the PlayStation Showcase 2023 last May, Concord is
      a PvP multiplayer FPS from developer Firewalk Studios that could be
      another title shown at the rumored May PlayStation Showcase. The game was
      originally given a 2024 release window when it was first announced but has
      seen few details since, potentially teeing it up for a grand re-reveal at
      this year's PlayStation Showcase.
